xdg-utils (1.0.2+cvs20100307-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * xdg-email now honors the $MAILER variable when deciding which mail
    user agent to use. Remember to wrap it in a terminal window if you're
    using a text-based mailer. For example:

    MAILER="xterm -e mutt"

    You can also list multiple mailers separated by colons, in which case
    xdg-email will try each one in order until one of them succeeds.
